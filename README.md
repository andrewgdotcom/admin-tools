admin-tools
===========

An eclectic selection of system administration tools.

admin-tools uses the poshlib submodule (https://github.com/andrewgdotcom/poshlib), so to clone this repo you should use:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/andrewgdotcom/admin-tools
```

An ever-increasing number of the tools are also usable as poshlib modules.
